## Assignment

Notifications A11

Notifications are one of the most recognizable features of Android: a functionality copied in its essence from other platforms, and updated every year by introducing continuous refinements.

Implement an app that exemplifies the main aspects of the notification system in Android, as well as all the innovations introduced in Android 11.

## Overview

ChorusChecker is an app that aims to be used as a language lab software; we would like the user to learn new terms, enriching his grammar and lexical knowledge by enjoying some good music. These features are connected with the innovations introduced in the notifications from Android 11 (like bubbles).

A user can select a song from those in the list, at this point he can play it and go back to listening the parts he prefers. While a bot will contact the user via a notification (which can become a bubble), this will ask the user 5 questions (or sentences to complete) related to the lyrics of the selected song.

If the user answers the first question correctly, the bot will move to the next one, otherwise it will continue to ask for the first question. When all the questions have been answered correctly, the song will be checked in the list.
